## `What Are PCI Security Standards ?`
- PCI Security Standards are developed and maintained by the PCI Security Standards Council to protect payment data throughout the payment lifecycle. The different PCI Standards support different stakeholders and functions within the payments industry.

Some of the PCI Standards are intended for use by organizations involved in payments, such as merchants, service providers, and financial institutions, to use within their own environments. These standards support the implementation of secure practices, technologies, and processes within the organization.

Other PCI Standards are intended for developers, technology vendors, and solution providers wishing to demonstrate that their product or service was designed with security in mind and meets a defined set of security requirements. These standards support the validation and listing of products and services that meet the standard and validation program requirements.

All PCI Security Standards are developed in conjunction with a global network of payments industry stakeholders.


## What is PCI DSS?
PCI DSS is a set of network security and business best practices guidelines adopted by the PCI Security Standards Council to establish a “minimum security standard” to protect customers’ payment card information. The scope of the PCI DSS includes all systems, networks, and applications that process, store, or transmit cardholder data, and also systems that are used to secure and log access to the systems in scope.
